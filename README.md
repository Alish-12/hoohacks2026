- 🥗 **Dietary filters** — vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free, halal, kosher
- 🍳 **Smart recipe matching** — recipes ranked by ingredient overlap with what you have
- 🖼️ **Food photography** — beautiful recipe photos powered by the Unsplash API
- ➕ **Add extra ingredients** — type in anything extra you have on hand
- ❌ **Remove ingredients** — remove anything the AI got wrong
